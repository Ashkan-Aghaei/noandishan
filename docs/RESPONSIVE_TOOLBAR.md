# Responsive Toolbar System

LeedPDF features an intelligent responsive toolbar system that automatically adapts to different screen sizes for optimal usability across all devices.

## How It Works

### Desktop Layout (lg+ screens, 1024px+)
- **Single top toolbar** containing all features in organized sections:
  - **Left Section**: Logo, Folder icon, Page Navigation (Previous/Next), Zoom Controls (Zoom In/Out), Reset/Fit Controls (Reset, Fit W, Fit H)
  - **Center Section**: All drawing tools (pen, eraser, text, arrow, highlighter, sticky note, stamps)
  - **Right Section**: Current tool indicator, Delete changes (trash icon), Light/Dark mode toggle, Undo, Redo, Search, Download
- Drawing tools and utility features are displayed side by side
- Full feature set accessible in one location
- 32px button sizes for mouse-friendly interaction
- No vertical dividers between button groups for cleaner appearance

### Mobile/Tablet Layout (below lg, <1024px)
- **Top toolbar**: Essential utility features
  - Logo, Undo, Redo, Search, Download
  - 3-dot menu containing secondary features:
    - Current tool info
    - File operations (Open other file)
    - Zoom controls (Reset size, Fit width, Fit height)
    - Navigation (Previous/Next page)
    - Actions (Delete changes)
    - Theme toggle
    - Credit section
- **Bottom toolbar**: Drawing tools
  - Pencil, eraser, text, arrows
  - Highlights, sticky notes, stamps
  - Color picker and line width controls
  - Page thumbnails toggle
- 44px button sizes for touch accessibility (WCAG compliant)

## Responsive Breakpoints

```css
/* Large screens and up - single toolbar */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .toolbar-top .drawing-tools { display: flex; }
  .toolbar-bottom { display: none; }
}

/* Below large screens - split toolbars */
@media (max-width: 1023px) {
  .toolbar-top .drawing-tools { display: none; }
  .toolbar-bottom { display: block; }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Top Toolbar (`toolbar-top`)
- Always visible on all screen sizes
- Contains utility features and navigation
- Drawing tools are hidden on small screens using `hidden lg:flex`
- Current tool indicator shows tool name and size (e.g., "Pencil 2px")
- Light/dark mode toggle uses emojis (ðŸŒž/ðŸŒ™) for better visual clarity
- Delete changes (trash icon) positioned to the left of download button

### Bottom Toolbar (`toolbar-bottom`)
- Only visible on small screens using `lg:hidden`
- Contains all drawing tools with larger touch targets
- Horizontal scrolling for overflow on very small screens
- Dropdowns open upward to avoid going off-screen

### State Synchronization
- Tool selection state is shared between both toolbars
- Active tool indicators work consistently across layouts
- Color and line width settings apply to both toolbars

## Mobile Optimizations

### Touch Targets
- Minimum 44px Ã— 44px touch targets on mobile
- Larger button sizes for better usability
- Proper spacing between interactive elements

### Overflow Handling
- Horizontal scrolling for bottom toolbar on small screens
- Hidden scrollbars for clean appearance
- Responsive padding and margins

### Dropdown Positioning
- Color picker and size selectors open upward on mobile
- Prevents dropdowns from going off-screen
- Maintains accessibility and usability

### 3-Dot Menu System
- Secondary features moved to accessible menu on mobile
- Prevents toolbar overcrowding
- Maintains all functionality while improving mobile UX

## Landing Page Responsiveness

### Title and Button Layout
- **Title**: Responsive sizing from `text-xl` (mobile) to `text-4xl` (desktop)
- **Primary Buttons**: "Choose PDF File" and "Open from URL" - responsive sizing
- **Secondary Buttons**: "Start Fresh", "Browse Templates", "Search PDFs"
  - Desktop: Always inline (`sm:flex-nowrap`)
  - Mobile: Inline when space allows, 3rd button wraps to next line when needed (`flex-wrap`)
  - Button width: `w-28` on mobile, `w-52` on larger screens
  - Text fits on one line within each button

## Testing Responsive Behavior

### Manual Testing
1. Open LeedPDF in your browser
2. Resize the browser window or use DevTools device simulation
3. Observe toolbar layout changes at the 1024px breakpoint
4. Test landing page button layout on various mobile screen sizes

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run responsive toolbar tests
npm run test:e2e -- toolbar-responsive.spec.ts
```

### Test Scenarios

- [ ] Responsive breakpoint behavior
- [ ] Mobile touch target sizes
- [ ] Dropdown positioning on mobile
- [ ] 3-dot menu functionality on mobile
- [ ] Landing page button responsiveness
- [ ] Current tool indicator visibility
- [ ] Light/dark mode toggle functionality

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Drawing tools not visible on mobile**
- Check if screen width is below 1024px
- Verify CSS classes are applied correctly
- Check for JavaScript errors in console

**Toolbar overlap issues**
- Ensure proper z-index values
- Check for conflicting CSS positioning
- Verify viewport meta tag is present

**Touch events not working**
- Confirm pointer events are enabled
- Check for CSS pointer-events conflicts
- Verify touch target sizes meet minimum requirements

**3-dot menu not appearing**
- Verify screen width is below 1024px
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Ensure menu state is properly managed

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging to troubleshoot responsive behavior:
```javascript
// Add to browser console for debugging
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
```

## Contributing

When contributing to the responsive toolbar system:

1. Test on multiple screen sizes
2. Ensure touch targets meet accessibility guidelines
3. Maintain consistent behavior across breakpoints
4. Update tests for new responsive features
5. Document any new breakpoints or behaviors
6. Test both light and dark themes
7. Verify 3-dot menu functionality on mobile devices
